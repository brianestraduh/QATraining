# QATraining


Frodo Baggins, a humble hobbit from the Shire, is entrusted with the One Ring, a powerful artifact that must be destroyed to defeat the dark lord Sauron.

Joined by a fellowship of allies including Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, they journey across Middle-earth facing danger and betrayal.

As the fellowship breaks, Frodo continues toward Mount Doom with Samwise Gamgee by his side.

Meanwhile, epic battles unfold as the forces of good rally to distract Sauronâ€™s eye.

In the end, Frodo succeeds in destroying the ring, bringing peace to the realm and fulfilling his perilous quest.
